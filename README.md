# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-System
In this project, deep learning and computer vision techniques are used for developing a real-time face mask identification system. In real-time, this technology can identify whether or not a person is wearing a face mask from live video transmissions. It uses OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to achieve this.
